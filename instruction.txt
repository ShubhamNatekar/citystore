1)Always write the changes that you have made on code into README file with description of what you have changed for the same commit.

2)Whenever we are going to start writing code first we need to do is "git pull" so that we will get the updated/current versions of files generated by us and then read the README file for understanding what work is done by the others for proceeding before our work.
